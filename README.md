## Scorched Earth Game Project

# Project Overview
Project of simple tank shooting game, created to learn about basics of C++ libraries like QML and Felgo. Goal was to create turn based artillery game with side-scrolled terrain with use of Felgo tools and R.U.B.E. ("Really Usefull Box2d Editor"), hovewer it seems this technology isn't supperted currently, R.U.B.E. application shuts off for some reasons. That makes creation of side-scrolled levels in Felgo impossible, and scope of this game has to be reduced.
